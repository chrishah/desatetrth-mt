MITObim was run via the slurm submission script 'MITObim.salaris.seed.slurm.sh'.

The final result from MITObim is checked for circularity using the script 'circules.py' that comes with MITObim.

```bash
~/src/MITObim/MITObim/misc_scripts/circules.py -f iteration33/temp_baitfile.fasta -k 31
```

Found one reasonable candidate. Extract to file.

```bash
~/src/MITObim/MITObim/misc_scripts/circules.py -f iteration33/temp_baitfile.fasta -k 31 -e 15000 -p tru1

```

However upon closer inspection, the coverage is rather low and there is a region with considerable assembly conflict in the mt mt genome reconstruction. So for this sample we've decided to use the complete paired end data instead of only merged reads for the reconstruction.
