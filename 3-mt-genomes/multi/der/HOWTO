Extract the relevant information from the results table of the selective COI mapping.

```bash
cat ../../../2-selective-COI-mapping/table.tsv |cut -f 1,2 > der_sp-proportions.txt
```

Prepare reference to be used for this sample.

```bash
mkdir seed_sal-der
cat ../../references/G.* > seed_sal-der/G.sal-der.mt.fasta
```

Run MITObim using both mitogenomes as reference at the same time and allowing for only 2 mismatches per read.



#Rerun with paired end reads rather than with merged reads
```bash
mkdir seed_sal-der_pe
cat ../../references/G.* > seed_sal-der_pe/G.sal-der.mt.fasta
```
